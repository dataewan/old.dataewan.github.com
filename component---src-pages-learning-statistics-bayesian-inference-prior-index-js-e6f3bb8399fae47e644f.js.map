Say for example you calculate the first statistical\n          moment (the mean) and the second statistical moment (the variance).\n          Why not use that for your prior?\n          This is where the terminology <i>moment matching priors</i> comes\n          from.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n          Informative priors seem to be recommended against.

Here the priors are informative\n          because they provide numeric information to the results, but these\n          seem to be more acceptable because there is less room for bias.

The idea is that you flatten the\n          informative prior distribution and make it less constraining. You\n          still get some regularisation because you tell the model where the\n          less likely values are, but you lower the risk of ruling out parts of\n          the parameter space which should be explored.\n        </Paragraph>\n      </Subsection>\n      <Subsection name=\"Uninformative priors\">\n        <Paragraph>\n          There are techniques that you can use to create prior distributions that contain no information in them.\n          For example the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffreys_prior\">Jefferys prior</a>.\n          These seem to be tricky to use in real world analysis,\n          and don't give any real benefit other than making you feel better.\n        </Paragraph>\n      </Subsection>\n      <Subsection name=\"Don't use constrained uniform priors unless it is a true constraint\">\n        <Paragraph>\n          One bit of clear advice I've picked up is that you should be very careful when picking a probability distribution that has zero at any point.\n          What you are saying with a prior that has zero values is that those values are impossible, and will never come through in the posterior distribution.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n          The example where you see this most often is when using the constrained uniform prior.\n          Say you want to describe the average lifespan of a human,\n          it is very tempting to use a uniform prior constrained between 0-100 for example.\n          This makes you feel better because you think that it is less informative than for example a normal distribution,\n          but what it does is guarantee that you'll never explore the space above 100.\n          This is bad and shouldn't be done.\n        </Paragraph>\n      </Subsection>\n    </Section>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Prior;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
