  Getting it to work properly with react is difficult,\n            the two libraries squabble with each other trying to control the DOM.\n            Elijah Meeks has a blog post that describes a few for getting the two to work together better.\n            I'm going to work through these examples here.\n          </Paragraph>\n          <Subsection name=\"Use React and D3 together\">\n            <Paragraph>\n              This option is the one that people tend to recommend.\n              You use D3 to inform all the drawing instructions.\n              So for example making scales that convert from the data space to the pixel space,\n              or converting data into a SVG path.\n              You then give these drawing instructions to react.\n              React handles the creating and updating of the DOM elements.\n            </Paragraph>\n            <Figure caption=\"Using only react to draw the SVG that makes the chart\">\n              <ReactAndD3 size={[500, 240]} data={this.state.data} />\n            </Figure>\n            <Paragraph>\n              The advantages of this method are that you get to take advantage of the react managment of the virtual DOM,\n              so performance should be better.\n              Also it means that you have less D3 in your code,\n              so it is easier to share with people with a react background.\n            </Paragraph>\n            <Paragraph note={\n              <div>\n              <a href=\"https://github.com/shauns/react-d3-axis\">\n                Implementing axis in pure react\n

            }>\n              The disadvantages are that there are some SVG elements that D3 is really good at drawing, like axes.\n              Drawing these without using D3 would be really tedious.\n              Additionally, \n              there are things like transitions that D3 does really well,\n              which aren't as easy to do in react.\n              There are ways to achieve the same effects by using pure react,\n              but I'm less experienced with these.\n            </Paragraph>\n          </Subsection>\n          <Subsection name=\"Use D3 as normal, and tell react to go away\">\n            <Paragraph>\n              This method feels more natural if you've used a lot of D3 in the past.\n              It probably is a good idea to transition more to using pure react for most things.\n              I'm going to keep this method in my pocket though.\n              If there is something that is really well implemented in D3, this will be a good option.\n              You can use all the same D3 code as you used previously.\n            </Paragraph>\n            <Figure caption=\"Using D3, and stopping react from updating the DOM\">\n

render method of your component,\n              you find the reference to the DOM element you're creating.\n            </Paragraph>\n            <Code language=\"javascript\" code={`\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <svg\n      ref={node => this.node = node}\n      width={ this.props.size[0] }\n      height={this.props.size[1]}/>\n  );\n}\n            `} />\n            <Paragraph>\n              <span className=\"mono\">this.node</span> is then a property of the component object.\n              In this example it will refer to the SVG DOM element. \n              The next trick is to intercept the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle\">\n                react lifecycle methods,\n              </a> and use them to trigger D3 functions to

a dataframe and return a copy of that dataframe with some changes applied.\n            Here I'm making two functions,\n            one that converts a string formatted date to a pandas date,\n            and a second one that extracts the year from that date. \n          </Paragraph>\n        <Code language='python' code={`\ndef convert_date(x):\n    return (\n        x\n        .assign(date =

you are making a chain that mutates the dataframe somehow,\n            let's say that we're making a new column.\n            If we want to use that new column in subsequent steps pandas will say that it can't find it.\n            Here I'm making a new date column, which I want to take the month from.\n          </Paragraph>\n          <Code language='python' code={`\n(\n    movies\n

<Paragraph>\n            If I'd been mutating in-place in the dataframe (assigning the new values to the release_date column),\n            then the second row would try and work with the original column and not the mutated one.\n            That can cause some tricky bugs.\n          </Paragraph>\n          <Paragraph>\n            Instead we can use the pipe function to get access to the mutated columns in subsequent stages of the chain.\n            I'm using <a href=\"https://dbader.org/blog/python-lambda-functions\">lambda functions</a> here because I don't intend to use them
